# ðŸŽ¯ Business Analyst Case Study: Indirect Tax Reporting with ETRM - Phase 2
This is Phase 2 of my work on a fictional case study project (for portfolio purposes) where I worked on improving indirect tax reporting in an Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM) system for a large oil &amp; gas trading company.

## 1. Project Background

In Phase 1, I led the project from defining the problem and current-state analysis - manual data handling, fragmented workflows, and compliance risks - to designing a future-state solution integrating a low-code tax engine for automated validation, reporting, and audit readiness. 

I established measurable goals (efficiency, compliance, agility), built a business case with ROI and risk analysis, and designed supporting artifacts such as process flows, stakeholder maps, and governance plans to ensure sustainable delivery. 

The project culminated in a clear, data-driven recommendation that demonstrated 90% automation and significant time and cost savings.
