# üéØ Business Analyst Case Study: Indirect Tax Reporting with ETRM - Phase 2
This is Phase 2 of my work on a fictional case study project (for portfolio purposes) where I worked on improving indirect tax reporting in an Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM) system for a large oil &amp; gas trading company.

This project highlights my ability to bridge **business and technical perspectives**, from defining problems and creating business cases, to documenting requirements, mapping data flows, and producing a developer-ready **Report Functional Specification**. It demonstrates key skills in **requirements analysis, data modeling, stakeholder alignment, and solution design** within a regulated enterprise environment.

## 1. Project Background  

In Phase 1, I did the following: 

- Identified problems & analyzed current state (manual data, fragmented workflows, compliance risks)
- Designed future-state solution with low-code tax engine for automated validation, reporting & audits
- Set clear goals: efficiency, compliance, agility
- Built business case: ROI & risk analysis
- Created key artifacts: process flows, stakeholder maps, governance plans
- Delivered recommendation: 90% automation, measurable time & cost savings

## 2. The Business Requirements Document (BRD)  

Having completed the Business Case, I used that foundation to develop the **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**.  


### üß© Key Activities
- Defined high-level business requirements aligned with the approved Business Case.  
- Identified dependencies affecting delivery or system behavior.  
- Created a high-level **use case diagram** to visualize user interactions.  
- Built a **gap analysis diagram** to highlight improvement areas.  
- Compiled a **glossary** for consistent terminology.

*Figure 1: High-Level Functional Requirements*  



> ‚ú® **Lesson Learned:** Traceability matters: linking each requirement back to a business objective prevents scope drift and ensures alignment.  

---

## 3. Digging into Requirement Details  

I transformed high-level goals into **detailed, testable functional and non-functional requirements**.  

### üîç Key Activities
- Developed detailed requirements tied to the BRD.  
- Defined measurable **acceptance criteria** for validation and testing.  
- Prioritized critical requirements.  
- Started a list of tax reports to be developed later.  

<img width="1792" height="1335" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9957cc21-df05-42e4-bdad-21faacfaca7a" />

*Figure 2: Acceptance Criteria*  


> ‚ú® **Lesson Learned:** Clarity drives collaboration. Testable requirements help align analysts, developers, and business users.  

---

## 4. Building the Functional Requirements Document (FRD)  

The **FRD** bridges business needs and technical design ‚Äî defining what the system should do so every team shares the same vision.  

### üß± Key Sections Developed
- **Use Cases:** Described user interactions and alternate/exception flows.  
- **Data Requirements:** Defined entities like transactions, tax rules, and reports.  
- **Interface Requirements:** Outlined system integrations to avoid silos.  
- **Reporting Overview:** Identified key tax reports and where details reside.  
- **Tax Rules Overview:** Emphasized the importance of accuracy for compliance.  
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** Linked business and functional requirements.

*Figure 3: List of Reports*  


> ‚ú® **Lesson Learned:** A strong FRD connects strategy to execution: giving developers clarity, stakeholders confidence, and teams alignment.

## 5. Starting with the Data  

Before finalizing report designs, I focused on **understanding the data** ‚Äî the foundation for accurate, compliant reporting.  

### üìä Key Activities
- Built a **high-level ERD** for the State Motor Fuel Tax Monthly Return.  
- Identified **key entities**, including Transactions, Movements, Tax Rules, and Jurisdictions.  
- Defined initial relationships between entities.  
- Scoped the model to one report to stay focused.  

<img width="1892" height="1310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c155de3a-0396-43f9-a77e-6d1fa0fc657d" />

*Figure 4: ERD*  


> ‚ú® **Lesson Learned:** A good data model reduces rework and builds trust in the reports you deliver.  

---

## 6. Getting More into Data and Diagrams  

After the ERD, I created a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** to understand how data moves through the system: connecting processes, data stores, and external actors.  

<img width="1800" height="1065" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a717c6c-51f4-4d43-8b07-fc6d3256347d" />

*Figure 5: DFD*  


> ‚ú® **Lesson Learned:** Visualizing data flow builds understanding: clarifying what each process consumes and produces.  

---

## 7. Bringing Data to Life  

I developed the **Data Dictionary**, bridging data structure and business context.  

### üìó My Approach
- Started from the **report spec** to define required fields.  
- Worked **backward** to identify each field‚Äôs source table and data type.  
- Included **sample data** for each table to make it tangible and contextual.  

<img width="2305" height="1330" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec0c4d5c-4470-4f2c-b693-84af6a1fd384" />

*Figure 6: Data Dictionary*  


> ‚ú® **Lesson Learned:** Seeing sample data makes the abstract concrete: revealing format and consistency issues early.  

---

## 8. Report Functional Specification  

One of the most rewarding milestones ‚Äî developing the **Report Functional Specification (RFS)** for the State Motor Fuel Tax Report.  

### üìò Key Activities
- Defined **business purpose**, fields to display, and filter parameters.  
- Mapped each report field to its **source** and defined **join logic**.  
- Created a **mockup layout** with sample data for realism.  
- Documented:  
  - Access permissions & data sensitivity  
  - Assumptions, dependencies, and constraints  
  - High-level testing scenarios for validation  

<img width="1690" height="670" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d7d481e-21e1-4d6d-88e3-22d875d11581" />

*Figure 7: Report Mockup*


> ‚ú® **Lesson Learned:** The RFS turns understanding into a buildable design: where business logic meets technical clarity.

- **Know when to stop analyzing.** Aim for ‚Äújust enough‚Äù to move forward.  
- **Iterate and validate.** First drafts are conversation starters.  
- **Diagrams expose dependencies.** They reveal missing data or gaps early.  
- **Always start with business purpose.** The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù shapes the ‚Äúwhat.‚Äù  
- **Consistency builds trust.** A clear Data Dictionary aligns teams.  
- **Visuals drive alignment.** ERDs, DFDs, and mockups turn complexity into shared understanding.
